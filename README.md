## What is this Repository?
This repository is a compilation of tutorials that I have put together to teach users the art of Deep Learning. The code in this repository is referenced in my [Medium article series: Deep Learning with PyTorch](https://jinalshah2002.medium.com). I highly recommend that you take the code and experiment with it. Experimenting with code is the best way to understand complex concepts in Computer Science as a whole. With that being said, feel free to use any or all of this code for your reference. 

## Modules/Libraries Used:
* [NumPy](https://numpy.org/doc/stable/)

## About the Author
I am an undergraduate student @ Rutgers University New Brunswick, who is pursing bachelor degrees in Computer Science and Cognitive Science. Furthermore, I am pursing a certificate in Data Science and a minor in Business Administration. I have a passion for AI ,and I am always intriguied by its power. I post weekly articles about deep learning on [Medium](https://jinalshah2002.medium.com). Feel free to check them out! Also, feel free to connect with me on [Linkedln](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jinalshah2002/). If you have any feedback, please let me know via email @ jinal.shah2821@gmail.com!
